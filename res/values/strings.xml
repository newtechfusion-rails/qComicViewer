		qComicViewer 1.3.0\n\n
		Welcome to qComicViewer.\n\n
		\tqComicViewer is meant to be a minimalist approach to other viewers on the market. 
		Although, there are some great viewers out there, I wanted to provide something slightly different. 
		\tI tried to make a solid reader that uses a very small amount of storage. 
		Taking up only 60KB, this app is great for installing on an SD card. 
		ZIP/CBZ/RAR/CBR compression support. 
		So when youâ€™re scanning your comics, be sure to zip them! Image support includes JPG/JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP.\n\n
		\tPlease feel free to contact me at nmquirk@gmail.com for any suggestions, comments or complaints.
